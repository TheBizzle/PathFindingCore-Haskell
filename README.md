PathFindingCore-Haskell
===============

This project contains building blocks for constructing your own pathfinding algorithm in Haskell and visually representing it in ASCII.  I tried to make these building blocks general (while still being useful), but it's worth noting that I've only ever utilized this library for implementing A*.

For an example usage, see [the corresponding Haskell A* library](https://github.com/TheBizzle/AStar-Haskell).

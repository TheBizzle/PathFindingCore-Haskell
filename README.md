PathFindingCore-Haskell
===============

This project contains building blocks for constructing your own pathfinding algorithm in Haskell and visually representing it in ASCII.  I tried to make these building blocks general (while still being useful), but it's worth noting that I've only ever utilized this library for implementing A*.

For an example of what this could be used for, see [the Scala version of this library](https://github.com/TheBizzle/PathFindingCore) being used in my [AStar](https://github.com/TheBizzle/PathFinding) project, or [here](https://github.com/TheBizzle/PathFinding/blob/master/AStar/src/main/org/bizzle/astar/base/AStarStepData.scala), [here](https://github.com/TheBizzle/PathFinding/blob/master/AStar/src/main/org/bizzle/astar/base/AStarBase.scala), and [here](https://github.com/TheBizzle/PathFinding/blob/master/AStar/src/main/org/bizzle/astar/AStar.scala).
